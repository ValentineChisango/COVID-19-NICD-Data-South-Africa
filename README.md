# COVID-19-NICD-Data-South-Africa
Provincial level data on Covid-19 cases and tests in South Africa

The .rmd file contains the code to extract the data from the .pdf files published by the National Institute for Communicable Diseases (NICD) and create the csv file for the data of interest (Table 1 in the .pdf files). Only the data from Table 1 is extracted, but the code can be modified in order to obtain other data.
